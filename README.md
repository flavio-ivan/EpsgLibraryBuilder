# EpsgLibraryBuilder
Stand-alone application to build repository with relevant Epsg codes.

This is a tool created with the purpose of building a .csv file with Epsg codes and Well Known Texts (WKT) that can be relevant for an application that is Coordinate Reference-aware.



Each Epsg code is unique, and each WKT contains alll parameters to describe both and Earth Geodatic Datum (describing the Earth's ellipsoid) and potentially a projection (like UTM projections).
